What does the code on a *Game Boy* cartridge mean? What language is the game in?

![Gameboy Cartridges](./images/cartridges.jpg)

The codes on the game cartridges are usually divided into three groups.
But in some cases it can be two or four groups.

The *Tetris* above for instance has the code `DMG-TR-EU` and *Super Mario Land* has `DMG-ML-SCN`.
The middle cartridge *Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru (カエルの為に鐘は鳴る)* only has two groups, `DMG-OKJ`.

### First Group - Console
The first group is three letters that show which *Game Boy* the game was released for.

- **DMG** - Game Boy (Dot Matrix Game)
- **CGB** - Game Boy Color (Color Game Boy)
- **AGB** - Game Boy Advance (Advance Game Boy)

### Second Group - Game
The second group is 2-4 letters and/or digits. This part of the code is the identifier for the game itself.
As you can see in the photo above, the code for *Tetris* is `TR`, and *Super Mario Land* is `ML`.

### Third Group - Country/Area
The third group is three letters showing what area the game was released in.
As you can see there are multiple overlaps.
To make things a little more confusing, some cartridges released in Japan doesn’t even have a country/area code, as you can see in the photo above.

- **ASI** – Asia (Not Japan or China)
- **AUS** – Australia
- **CAN** – Canada
- **CHN** – China
- **ESP** – Spain
- **EUR** – Europe & Australia
- **FAH** – France & Netherlands
- **FRA** – France & Belgium
- **FRG** – Germany, Switzerland, Germany
- **GPS** – Used for countries/areas without a matching code.
- **HOL** – Netherlands & Belgium
- **ITA** – Italy
- **JAP** – Japan
- **NOE** – Germany
- **SCN** – Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland)
- **UKV** – United Kingdom
- **USA** – USA & Mexico

### Fourth Group - Incrementation
Some cartridges have a fourth group, consisting of a single digit.
This is an incrementation number that is added when a new revision is released with changes in hardware, packaging or labels.
